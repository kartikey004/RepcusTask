## #FIX JIRA (RepcusTask)

## Why I built this
I use Jira a lot and while it is a great tool, creating a ticket is a **boring chore**. You have to click through multiple fields, open dropdowns and fill out forms one by one. This breaks my focus and wastes time.

I built **#FIX JIRA** to solve this friction. Instead of filling out forms, you can create a structured ticket just by typing one line.
